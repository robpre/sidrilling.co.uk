Capable of drilling to depths of 50m, in certain drilling materials
This rig can be disassembled and carried through buildings, up or down stairs using a Stair Climber and then assembled at the borehole position.
Again this rig is used in basements, warehouses and difficult to access projects. We have full 30m+ of fume extraction to accompany this rig when required
To achieve this depth the borehole would be cased to a maximum depth of 25m then open holed to 50m, using 200mm/150mm casing size. In the right drilling conditions 250mm could be used to a max depth of 5m.

- Diesel PowerPlant: Yanmar 10BH (single cylinder):
    - Requires fume extraction in enclosed spaces, which we supply
- Electric PowerPlant: Siemens 415v,30amp
    - Requires 3 phase power, either on site or we can hire a generator
- Min site access width: 600mm
- Min erected drill height: 2.4m
- Min erected drill area: 1.6m x 4m
