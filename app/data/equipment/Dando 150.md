Low headroom/restricted access rig (Trailer mounted)
Capable of drilling to maximum depth of 50m, in certain materials, finishing in 150mm casing
To achieve this we would start in 250mm casing, reduce to 200mm casing and then finish the final phase of the borehole in 150mm casing.
This particular rig would be used in car parks, warehouses, (one project was in a Victorian greenhouse) or where the width of access is narrower than 2m.

- Power plant: Lister-Petter PH2 (Twin cylinder)
- Min Deployed drill width: 1.1m
- Min Deployed drill height: - 3.0m
- Max drill depth: 50m
- Casing diameters: 250mm, 200mm, 150mm
