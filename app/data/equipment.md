# EQUIPMENT
All equipment has current and appropriate LOLLER certificates of which copies can be forwarded by email upon request. Driller crews’ carry copies of certificates with them.
Before drilling begins a PUWER (Provisions and Use of Work Regulations 1998 – HSE directed) checklist and sheet completed to ensure equipment is suitable and safe for use. 

## Dando 2000 Mk 2 PHOTO of all rigs and equipment
We have six rigs of this type
Mechanical Winch 2 Tonne max lift
Capable of drilling to a maximum depth of 50m finishing in 150mm casing
To achieve this depth we would start in 250mm casing, reduce to 200mm casing and then finish the final phase of the borehole in 150mm casing.
Power plant: Lister-Petter TR2 (Twin cylinder)

## Dando 3000 Mk 2 
Mechanical Winch 3 Tonne max lift 
Capable of drilling to depths of 70m finishing in 150mm.
To achieve this we would start in 300mm casing, reduce to 250mm casing, reduce again to 200mm and then finish the final phase of the borehole in 150mm casing.
Power plant : Lister-Petter TR3 (Three cylinder)

## Dando 150
Low headroom/restricted access rig (Trailer mounted)
Capable of drilling to maximum depth of 40m finishing in 150mm casing
To achieve this we would start in 250mm casing, reduce to 200mm casing and then finish the final phase of the borehole in 150mm casing.
Power plant : Lister-Petter PH2 (Twin cylinder)
This particular rig would be used in car parks, warehouses, (one project was in a Victorian greenhouse) or where the width of access is narrower than 2m. 

Min width of Low-Headroom rig is 1.1m
Min drill height - 3.0m 

## De-mountable Rig (transported disassembled in secure trailer/Transit)
Capable of drilling to depths of 40m
This rig can be disassembled and carried through buildings, up or down stairs using a Stair Climber and then assembled at the borehole position.
Again this rig is used in basements, warehouses and difficult to access projects. We have full 30m+ of fume extraction to accompany this rig when required 
To achieve this depth the borehole would be cased to a maximum depth of 25m then open holed to 40m, using 200mm/150mm casing size. In the right drilling conditions 250mm could be used to a max depth of 5m. 
PowerPlant: Yanmar 10BH (single cylinder)

-Min width of De-mountable rig 600mm
-Min drill height - 2.3m
