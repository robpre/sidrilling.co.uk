### The Site

Willoughby Lane is a 100 acre old gas works site, situated near Edmonton. The site is registered as a RED site. Historically large gasometers had leaked gas oil into the ground over many years.

### Scope

Due to the hazardous nature of the site, stringent Health and safety measures, over and above typical locations, have been implemented.
S I Drilling have been involved on the site since early 2016. Boreholes have been drilled to a maximum depth of  50m using 300mm, 250mm, 200mm and 150mm casing. As instructed, our skilled teams have installed valuable stainless steel standpipes in some of the boreholes. The monitoring and recovery wells will be used in a pumping and filtration process to help clean the soils.
