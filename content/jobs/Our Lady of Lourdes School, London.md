### The Site

Our Lady of Lourdes is a Catholic primary school in London.
Possible contamination and UXO risks.
Drilling was required during school term time.

### Scope

Six boreholes drilled were located within the grounds of a primary school and requested to assess geotechnical properties as well as contamination levels of the soil to inform feasibility studies for re-development schemes. We used 200mm and 150mm casing to a maximum depth of 20m.
To minimise disruption and damage to the school surroundings, protective ground mats and clean drilling processes was used.
We worked alongside UXO specialists who carry out ordnance clearance testing. Safe drilling practise of 2m of 200mm stainless steel low magnetic casing was used with additional standard casing to enable the hole to get through the Made Ground.
