### At A Glance

- three 10m boreholes in 200mm casing with installations

### The Site

Dorset House is a site located off the Marylebone Road (A40) in central London. The borehole positions were inside a car park with a ceiling height of 3m.

### Scope

S I Drilling utilised the Low Headroom Rig which can function with a minimum height of 3m. We drilled holes in 200mm with varying depths to a maximum of 10m. Our fume extraction kit was used on several of the holes as they were located underground and therefore limited fresh air.
