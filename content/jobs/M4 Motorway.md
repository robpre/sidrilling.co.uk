Boreholes vital to assess the required process to upgrading to ‘smart technology’ being developed and upgraded along the route.

### Scope
Numerous boreholes have been, and continue to be drilled to a maximum depth of 50m.
SI Drilling have been one company along with others as part of the M4 redevelopment.
We used 250mm, 200mm and 150mm casing to achieve the depths required.  Drilling progression has needed to coincide with strict Road Traffic Managements and road user needs.
S I Drilling have had between 1-2 rigs on this project since May 2016, involving both day and night drilling shifts.
