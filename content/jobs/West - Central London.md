### The Site
Located in the Westend of London, where subterranean building and development is increasingly necessary, the site required in depth investigation into soil strata to determine future construction.  Drilling inside an existing building requested.

### Scope
This project was undertaken inside an existing building using our De-mountable Rig since the only access was via a stairway.  With our de-mountable rig we are able to deconstruct the rig in sections , mobilise through doorways and down stairs to reassemble at  borehole position. This rig is capable of being assembled almost anywhere. Once erected, the frame is as powerful and strong - if not stronger- than a standard rig, due to its smaller size. The borehole was drilled using 150mm casing. Testing and sampling taken insitu and 12m pipe installed
