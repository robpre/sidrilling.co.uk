### At A Glance
- One 15m borehole  at railway station

### The Site

Appleford Station, Oxfordshire, required borehole drilling on grass areas either side of the railway tracks. One borehole only accessible via a footbridge across the track.

### Scope

Our De-mountable Rig can be transported and assembled in almost any location, which made it a perfect choice for this project. The rig and drilling equipment had to be taken down flights of steps, from a bridge down to the trackside, and then carried on trolleys down the platform. Our four person crew manoeuvred equipment across rough ground approximately 50m behind the platform to the borehole locations. Our heavier items were transported via a stairclimber. The boreholes were drilled in 150mm casing to a depth of 10m.
