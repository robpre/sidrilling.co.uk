### The Site
Wreningham is a site in our home county of Norfolk. Like many Norfolk sites, it is built on layers of chalk. The water well was drilled for domestic purposes for a private home owner.

### Scope
The project involved drilling a well in 250mm and 200mm to enable the land owner to pump water from the chalk layers at depth. Water boreholes are extremely unique and often unpredictable from hole to hole on the same land just meters apart. This particular well, after considerable research took approximately one week. The client was extremely appreciative of the successful job and water yield produced.
