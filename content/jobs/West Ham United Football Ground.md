### At A Glance

- 25 boreholes
- 10m -30m bgl
- 150mm, 200mm and 250mm casing

### The Site

West Ham United Football Ground, East London.
Site investigation required to assess the approach for redevelopment of the grounds.
The site is built on thick layers of lime stone and other dense materials in the Lambeth group.

### Scope

This six-week project used 250mm, 200mm and 150mm casing. The drilling was extremely difficult at times, due to the limestone layers encountered in the Lambeth Group. S I Drilling found the solution to this problem by means of a 250mm sectional tool which helped keep the borehole straight when drilling through cohesive materials. To reduce casing from 250mm to 200mm, the sectional tool allows the casing to reach the base of the hole without touching the sides.
